# Nuclear.TestSite

`Nuclear.TestSite` is an instruction set for the test platform [Nuclear.Test](https://github.com/MikeLimaSierra/Nuclear.Test).
There is a range of test instructions included, that makes unit testing and integration testing quick and efficient.
Please find the required packages on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nuclear.TestSite/).

This is a quick and dirty readme with very little information due to the current pre-release state. There is going to be more in the near future.

## Benefits

* The principle of one assert per test (also known as [OAPT](https://randycoulman.com/blog/2014/06/17/one-assertion-per-test/)) does not apply to `Nuclear.TestSite`.
